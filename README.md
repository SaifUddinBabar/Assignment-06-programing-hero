1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var: old way, use before ES6. Can change value and can use outside block.  
let: new way, can change but only inside block.  
const: cannot change, always same.  


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
map(): make new array with change, always return new array.  
forEach(): just loop, not return anything.  
filter(): check condition, give new array with only true item.  



3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow function is short way to write function. Easy and small than normal function.  


4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring mean take value from array or object easy way. We can take many value in one line.  



5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literal use backtick. We can put variable inside `${ }`. It is easy and clean. Old string need `+` for join, template literal no need.
